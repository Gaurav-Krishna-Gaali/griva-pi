# Audio Files for VIA Timer

This folder should contain the following audio files for the VIA timer functionality:

1. `timer_start.mp3` - Sound played when timer starts
2. `timer_stop.mp3` - Sound played when timer is manually stopped
3. `timer_complete.mp3` - Sound played when timer automatically completes (reaches 0)

## Recommended Audio Characteristics:
- **timer_start.mp3**: Short, crisp sound (0.5-1 second) indicating timer activation
- **timer_stop.mp3**: Different short sound (0.5-1 second) indicating timer cancellation
- **timer_complete.mp3**: Distinctive sound (1-2 seconds) indicating timer completion

## File Format:
- Use MP3 format for compatibility
- Keep file sizes small (under 100KB each)
- Use clear, distinct sounds that won't be confused with each other

## Alternative:
If you don't have specific audio files, the app will gracefully handle missing files and continue to work without audio feedback.
